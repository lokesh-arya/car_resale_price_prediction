# Car Resale Value Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the resale value of used cars based on various features like age, mileage, brand, fuel type, and more. Multiple regression models are implemented and compared to determine the most accurate and reliable approach.

---

## Problem Statement

The goal is to build a machine learning model that can estimate the resale price of a car, helping both sellers and buyers make informed pricing decisions. The project involves:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Model training and evaluation
* Comparison of multiple regression algorithms
